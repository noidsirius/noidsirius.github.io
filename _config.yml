about: "I'm Navid, a Ph.D. student at <a href=\"https://uci.edu/\">the University of Calirofnia, Irvine</a> working with <a href=\"https://www.ics.uci.edu/~malek/\">Prof. Sam Malek</a>.
My research interests lie primarily in <a href=\"https://www.sigsoft.org/index.html\">Software Engineering</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sigaccess.org/\">Accessible Computing</a>.
I design and develop automated tools by leveraging program analysis and machine learning techniques to detect and fix accessibility issues in mobile apps.
